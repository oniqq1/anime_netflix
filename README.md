# 🎬 Anime Netflix - Steins;Gate Fan Platform

A themed web application dedicated to **Steins;Gate**, where users can watch both seasons, create accounts, customize their profile, and interact through comments.

This project was developed as a **final course project** to demonstrate full-stack development skills using Django.
